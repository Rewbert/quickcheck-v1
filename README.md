#### QuickCheck V1
---

This is a runnable version of the original QuickCheck implementation, written by [Koen](https://www.cse.chalmers.se/~koen/) Claessen & [John](https://www.cse.chalmers.se/~rjmh/) Hughes. The code was taken from [here](https://www.cse.chalmers.se/~rjmh/QuickCheck/QuickCheck.hs), but modified slightly to run in 2023. The commit illustrating the changes required to run it is [here](https://github.com/Rewbert/quickcheck-v1/commit/392daabe04b0fffb3e10d5c2bbb68c5d6cff9fd8).

The original QuickCheck documentation can be found [here](https://www.cse.chalmers.se/~rjmh/QuickCheck/manual.html), where the above code was taken from. The link to the code from that website is broken, but the right link is given above.
